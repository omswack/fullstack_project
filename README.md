### Leveraging Spotify's REST API to dynamically present music playlists


+ MusicaHub is a full-stack music discovery web application that dynamically displays up-to-date selected Spotify music playlists. The application utilizes multiple user states such as new user, admin, and existing user. I developed SQL schema to manage user metadata and permission states, as well as CRUD functionality through the admin page.

### Tech Stack
+ [Spotify Rest API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)
+ SQL (via MySQL Workbench)
+ PHP (for server side database management)
+ HTML/CCS Bootstrap

### Notes
+ To host the application, I used MAMP. The SQL schema and PHP files will need to be uploaded to your own server to gain functionality
+ Download the .zip file to maintain file structure and view additional media used in the project
+ For a great description of the project and functionality, check the attacked PDF.
